# Dali Data Challenge

## Andy Feng

### Directories
The `code` directory contains the R script, `script.R`, used to create the visualizations.
To create the visualizations, the user may run the entire script at once. There are multiple data frames titled the same name, so the user must run each section of the script in order to produce a visualization again.

The `visualizations` directory contains the figures produced from `script.R`. They are pdfs with size 6 by 8.


### Part 1 and 2
For part 1 of the challenge, I created several figures that represented the data. These included a map, bar charts, and a pie chart. For part 2, I explored an futile but interesting idea that cities with different start letters lead to different profits. I found that cities that start with "p" have significantly lower profits and used a bar chart to visualize this. This is by no means causation, just a correlation. I also looked at if having discounts on products affected profits, and found that there is definitely a negative and significant correlation between discounts and profits.
