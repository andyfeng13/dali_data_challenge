# Dali Data Challenge

## Andy Feng

The `code` directory contains the R script, `script.R`, used to create the visualizations.
To create the visualizations, the user may run the entire script at once. There are multiple data frames titled the same name, so the user must run each section of the script in order to produce a visualization again.

The `visualizations` directory contains the figures produced from `script.R`. They are pdfs with size 6 by 8.
